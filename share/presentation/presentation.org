#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
In the final project students were tasked with creating a collection of tools
that allow a user to encrypt and decrypt messages using the RSA encryption
algorithm and embed and extract messages (either plaintext or ciphertext) from
BMP images and WAV audio files.

** DickGrayson
*** Introduction
/DickGrayson/ is a collection of tools that allow a user to encrypt and decrypt
messages using the RSA encryption algorithm and embed and extract messages
(either plaintext or ciphertext) from BMP images and WAV audio files.

*** Tools
- =munchkincrypt= :: (aka =rsa-crypt=) RSA Encryption
- =dorothy= :: (aka =rsa-attack=) RSA Attacks
- =munchkinsteg= :: (aka =stego-crypt=) Steganography
- =toto= :: (aka =stego-attack=) Steganography Attacks

* Design
** Design Decisions
*** DickGrayson
- Target OS :: Linux =x86_64= (=build.tamu.edu=)
- Compiler :: [[https://gcc.gnu.org/][GCC 4.9.2]]
- Language :: C++14
- Build System :: [[https://cmake.org][CMake]]
- Numerics :: [[https://gmplib.org][GNU Multiple Precision Library]]
- Unit Testing :: [[https://code.google.com/p/googletest/][Google Test]]
- Continuous Integration :: [[http://travis-ci.org][travis-ci]]
- Code Coverage :: [[http://coveralls.io][coveralls]]
** Implementation Decisions
*** RSA Encryption
- Especially, explain what attacks you chose to make for both RSA and stego, and
  how your two stego schemes work 
- Show proofs of Test-Driven Development (screenshots of failing / passing
  tests, GitHub revision history, running test code in the demo, etc) 
*** RSA Attacks
- Attacked using one general purpose attack, which would work on any rsa key, 
  then created two more specific attacks that are efficient in some cases.

** Implementation Decisions (cont.)
*** Steganography
*** Steganography Attacks
- Attack using md5 and extract from Munchkinsteg BMP and WAV
- Attack using LSB scramble for BMP and WAV
* Demonstration
** Build System & Tools
- Travis
- Coveralls
** =rsa-crypt=
- generate primes
- generate public and private keys
- encrypt and decrypt example messages
** =rsa-attack=
*** factorization
Trial division method brute forces factorization only trying primes. 
Will break any RSA key no matter how big!*
*given enough time
*** common modulus
Common modulus takes advantage of a shared n between two separate key/crypttext. 
Through some clever exponenetiation, we can obtain the original message.
*** low exponent
Low exponent attack works wherever you have e identical messages with different parties. 
Clearly, this is most effective and practical when e = 3.
** =stego-crypt=
*** How it works
Our tool munchkinsteg supports image and audio least significant bit (LSB)
steganography. The formats supported are Windows 8-bit BMP and PCM 16-bit WAV.
*** Embedding message
The data is broken up into bits and each bit is stored consecutively in the LSB
of the individual pixels and samples of the bmp and wav file respectively. A
null byte is stored using 8 additional pixels/samples to be used during
extraction as a termination symbol.
** =stego-crypt= (cont.)
*** Extracting message
The LSB of the individual pixels and samples of the bmp and wav file
respectively are extracted and concatenated into a string. This process
terminates once a null byte is reached.
