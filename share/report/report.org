#+BEGIN_COMMENT
The board of Munchkin Incorporated expects to receive a final report of your
work and a brief presentation demonstrating the tools you built. The report
should include details about how you solved each problem in this project,
especially with regard to Test-Driven Development and Agile Programming. Your
report also should also include the division of labor, specifying who did what
and the value of that contribution to the overall project. Attached to the
report, you should submit copies of your weekly Sprint progress reports,
complete with Backlogs, Burndown charts, and Sprint Status Checks. Your
presentation during the final exam should last no more than 10 minutes and
should clearly demonstrate your usage of Test-Driven Development and Agile Programming, as well as the correct operation of your tools. Stay true to the
Agile methodology, do not submit or demo something which is not yet finished.

* Introduction
/DickGrayson/ is a collection of tools that allow a user to encrypt and decrypt
messages using the RSA encryption algorithm and embed and extract messages
(either plaintext or ciphertext) from BMP images and WAV audio files.

* Tools
- =munchkincrypt= :: RSA Encryption
- =dorothy= :: RSA Attacks
- =munchkinsteg= :: Steganography
- =toto= :: Steganography Attacks

* Agile Programming
For this project we were to make use of the "Agile Software Development"
ideology and in particular the "Scrum" method. In short this meant instead of
using an ad-hoc organization method (read: none at all), we divided the
four-week development time allocated into four "sprints". In addition we had
five meetings, one every weekday at 15:00. On Mondays a planning meeting was
held in which we decided on what tasks would define this weeks' sprint. In
addition we estimated the difficulty of each card to avoid under or over
estimating the amount of work one could accomplish in a week.

The canonical way to organize and store organization information for a project
is a white board but because we did not have access to a physical white-board we
opted to use trello.com instead.

** Problems Encountered
* Test-Driven Development
Test-Driven Development is development strategy where one writes out the tests
for a segment of code, usually a single class or header, /before/ one writes the
code. The tests should initially all fail and then functionality should be
implemented such that the tests pass. This ensures that one does not
unconsciously write their tests to pass even if their code is broken.

Our team also made use of travis-io.com for continuous integration. Travis
builds each push to the git repository for all branches and pull requests.
Travis then signals whether or not the code built and passed the tests. After it
has built and run all the tests, Travis can tell us which tests passed or
failed.

In addition, we configured travis to build the code with code-coverage analytics
which were then analyzed by coveralls.io. This allows us to analyze what parts
of the codebase are being executed and how many times. This is particularly
useful when checking what percentage of the codebase is actually being tested in
our tests. Coverage also gives us some insight into what parts of the code are
being "hit" hardest, e.g. a loop is being run 1,000,000 times. This sometimes
allowed us to optimize the order of conditions in a loop such that the loop is
run fewer times or breaks earlier.
** Problems Encountered
* RSA Encryption
 Rsa Key generation
We generate large enough numbers using the gmp library. Those randomly generated p 
and q values are then used to calculate totient, d, and e.
 Encryption and decryption
Encryption happens by splitting up the passed in message into blocks to keep values 
less than the bit size of n. The blocks are converted into ascii values, and each 
block is delimited by a "-" so that when it is passed into the decryption function, 
we know at what increments to pass the values into the mod formula in.
** Problems Encountered
Dealing with the new library was particularly challenging as well as the encryption and 
decryption of the plaintext message.
* Steganography
Our steganography tool, Munchkinsteg, supports two different embedding media:
8-bit Windows BMP (image), and PCM 16-bit WAV (sound). Both types of steganography
are based on last significant bit (LSB). Before embedding the message, we append
the null byte to it. When extracting, we stop at the null byte and return everything
extracted minus the null byte.
** BMP Image Files
Our tool supports only 8-bit Windows BMP which means only one subpixel per pixel.
We used the EasyBMP library for interfacing with the BMP format. The LSB of each
subpixel (and thus each pixel) contains one sequential bit of the embedded message.
** WAV Audio Files
Our tool supports only PCM 16-bit WAV images. There are other types of WAV formats;
compression and rounding issues prevent LSB steganography from working correctly for
formats other than PCM 16-bit. We used libsndfile for interfacing with the WAV format.
The PCM 16-bit WAV format consists of an array of 16-bit sound samples. The LSB of
each sound sample contains one sequential bit of the embedded message.
** Problems Encountered
Originally we tried writing our own BMP library. We found that it was much easier
to write an interface to EasyBMP. When we decided to implement the WAV format, we
moved straight to the idea of writing an interface to libsndfile. At first, we didn't
realize that only PCM 16-bit WAV would work. Once we did, we had no problem getting
support for WAV steganography to work.
