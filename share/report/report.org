#+BEGIN_COMMENT
The board of Munchkin Incorporated expects to receive a final report of your
work and a brief presentation demonstrating the tools you built. The report
should include details about how you solved each problem in this project,
especially with regard to Test-Driven Development and Agile Programming. Your
report also should also include the division of labor, specifying who did what
and the value of that contribution to the overall project. Attached to the
report, you should submit copies of your weekly Sprint progress reports,
complete with Backlogs, Burndown charts, and Sprint Status Checks. Your
presentation during the final exam should last no more than 10 minutes and
should clearly demonstrate your usage of Test-Driven Development and Agile
Programming, as well as the correct operation of your tools. Stay true to the
Agile methodology, do not submit or demo something which is not yet finished.
